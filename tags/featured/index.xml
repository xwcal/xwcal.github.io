      <description>1 Introduction Daniel Fedorin investigated an intriguing phenomenon where rich patterns arise out of an extremely simple algorithm:&#xA;Generate a finite sequence of integers, then iterate though the sequence repeatedly: at each step, draw a line segment of that integer length and then turn a fixed angle. This post extends Daniel&#39;s excellent work and delves deeper into the math behind this magic 1.&#xA;Here is a demo for those who have yet to appreciate the magic.</description>

Working on the puzzle was a wonderful process of meditation in a time of turmoil, and of reliving the peaceful memories of an aspiring student of math, statistics and computer science 2.&#xA;Somewhat surprisingly, I was able to recall the techniques in calculus and probability theory I hadn&#39;t touched for years.</description>
