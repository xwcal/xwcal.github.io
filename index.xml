      <description>Bugfix The previous algorithm contains a flagrant bug 1 that managed to elude my attention. Here is an updated version with VDJ-122 and VDJ-221 modified (the definitions in my previous post are a prerequisite):&#xA;For u, v \in \mathcal{B}_{s,t} $u, v \in \mathcal{B}_{s,t}$, u \neq v $u \neq v$:&#xA;If dist_{G-\mathcal{B}_{s,t}+u+v}(u,v) $dist_{G-\mathcal{B}_{s,t}+u+v}(u,v) &lt; \infty$:&#xA;If dist(s,u) \le dist(s,v) $dist(s,u) \le dist(s,v)$:&#xA;Return True&#xA;Elif VDJ-122(\mathcal{B}_{s,t}, s, u, v) $(\mathcal{B}_{s,t}, s, u, v)$ and</description>

      <description>1 The detour problem The statement given by Antoine Amarilli is rephrased here:&#xA;Given a directed graph G = (V,E) $G = (V,E)$, a source s \in V $s \in V$ and a target t \in V $t \in V$ reachable from s $s$, decide if there a simple directed path from s $s$ to t $t$ whose length (in terms of edge count) is greater than that of the shortest path from s $s$ to t $t$.</description>

      <description>Suppose we have a Stern-Gerlach device exhibiting particle-like behavior 1, such that in the x $x$ direction, we have a complete basis: \{ |measure_{+x}\rangle, |measure_{-x}\rangle \} $\{ |measure_{+x}\rangle, |measure_{-x}\rangle \}$, akin to a spin-\frac{1}{2} $\frac{1}{2}$ particle, which has \{ |spin_{+x}\rangle, |spin_{-x}\rangle \} $\{ |spin_{+x}\rangle, |spin_{-x}\rangle \}$.&#xA;Suppose the Stern-Gerlach device is configured as in Feynman&#39;s beautiful exposition 2 to block the lower beam, allowing only particles that take the upper route to fly through.</description>

      <description>Recently I found in my drawer some five pages of scribble dating back to Mar 2023, of my solution to that month&#39;s Jane Street Puzzle 1. Working on the puzzle was a wonderful process of meditation in a time of turmoil, and of reliving the peaceful memories of an aspiring student of math, statistics and computer science 2.&#xA;Somewhat surprisingly, I was able to recall the techniques in calculus and probability theory I hadn&#39;t touched for years.</description>

      <title>A few words on exponentiation</title>

      <description>Although MathJax dominates today&#39;s html+latex landscape, I always feel reader-side rendering of latex leaves much to be desired.&#xA;After getting my writer-side svg generation and embedding engine up and running, I thought, why not write something to test drive it? So here it goes.&#xA;Mathematics First, note that a^b $a^b$ (a^b or a**b in most programming languages) is right associative. So, 2^{3^4} = 2^{81} $2^{3^4} = 2^{81}$, an enormous number of 25 digits, not (2^3)^4 $(2^3)^4$, which is merely 4096.</description>

      <description>About me Knowledgeable about AI, distributed computing, foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science. Proficient in a few programming languages and fewer natural languages.&#xA;Quote New scientific ideas never spring from a communal body, however organized, but rather from the head of an individually inspired researcher who struggles with his problems in lonely thought and unites all his thought on one single point which is his whole world for the moment.</description>
