      <description>1 The detour problem The statement given by Antoine Amarilli is rephrased here:&#xA;Given a directed graph G = (V,E) $G = (V,E)$, a source s \in V $s \in V$ and a target t \in V $t \in V$ reachable from s $s$, decide if there a simple directed path from s $s$ to t $t$ whose length (in terms of edge count) is greater than that of the shortest path from s $s$ to t $t$.</description>

      <description>Suppose we have a Stern-Gerlach device exhibiting particle-like behavior 1, such that in the x $x$ direction, we have a complete basis: \{ |measure_{+x}\rangle, |measure_{-x}\rangle \} $\{ |measure_{+x}\rangle, |measure_{-x}\rangle \}$, akin to a spin-\frac{1}{2} $\frac{1}{2}$ particle, which has \{ |spin_{+x}\rangle, |spin_{-x}\rangle \} $\{ |spin_{+x}\rangle, |spin_{-x}\rangle \}$.&#xA;Suppose the Stern-Gerlach device is configured as in Feynman&#39;s beautiful exposition 2 to block the lower beam, allowing only particles that take the upper route to fly through.</description>

      <description>Recently I found in my drawer some five pages of scribble dating back to Mar 2023, of my solution to that month&#39;s Jane Street Puzzle 1. Working on the puzzle was a wonderful process of meditation in a time of turmoil, and of reliving the peaceful memories of an aspiring student of math, statistics and computer science 2.&#xA;Somewhat surprisingly, I was able to recall the techniques in calculus and probability theory I hadn&#39;t touched for years.</description>

      <title>A few words on exponentiation</title>

      <description>Although MathJax dominates today&#39;s html+latex landscape, I always feel reader-side rendering of latex leaves much to be desired.&#xA;After getting my writer-side svg generation and embedding engine up and running, I thought, why not write something to test drive it? So here it goes.&#xA;Mathematics First, note that a^b $a^b$ (a^b or a**b in most programming languages) is right associative. So, 2^{3^4} = 2^{81} $2^{3^4} = 2^{81}$, an enormous number of 25 digits, not (2^3)^4 $(2^3)^4$, which is merely 4096.</description>
