      <description>1 Introduction Daniel Fedorin investigated an intriguing phenomenon where rich patterns arise out of an extremely simple algorithm:&#xA;Generate a finite sequence of integers, then iterate though the sequence repeatedly: at each step, draw a line segment of that integer length and then turn a fixed angle. This post extends Daniel&#39;s excellent work and delves deeper into the math behind this magic 1.&#xA;Here is a demo for those who have yet to appreciate the magic.</description>

      <description>While ruminating on the difficulty of irreducible saw patterns, I took another look at Fortune et al. and noticed the following mention of On the complexity of time table and multi-commodity flow problems by Even et al.:&#xA;We note that the result of Even, Itai and Shamir [2] on multicommodity flows implies that the directed subgraph homeomorphism problem is NP-complete if both pattern and input graphs are given as input, even if the input graph is acyclic.</description>

      <description>To facilitate our discussion, let&#39;s expand the existing definitions and make a few things formal. For u,v \in V $u,v \in V$, let&#39;s refer to a simple path in G-\mathcal{B}_{s,t}+u+v $G-\mathcal{B}_{s,t}+u+v$ (ie. completely outside \mathcal{B}_{s,t} $\mathcal{B}_{s,t}$ except the end points) from u $u$ to v $v$ as a hop from u $u$ to v $v$. We say it is forward if dist(s,u) $dist(s,u) &lt; dist(s,v)$, lateral if dist(s,u) = dist(s,v) $dist(s,u) = dist(s,v)$, and backward if dist(s,u) &gt; dist(s,v) $dist(s,u) &gt; dist(s,v)$.</description>

      <title>Bugfix: detour problem solution needs [not] transitive closure</title>

      <description>Bugfix EDIT 20240408: What can I say about a bad brain fart? Guess there is no substitute for letting an idea sit for a while, preferably over at least a night of sound sleep, so that I get a chance to see my own mistakes. In going from one extreme (research, but never publish) to another, I have removed the gate that keeps my mistakes from escaping into the wild. Despite the cost (confusion to my readers, if any, and embarrassment to myself), I will keep this experiment going: this is the first time I do research completely in the open and document the process as I go.</description>

      <description>Bugfix The previous algorithm contains a flagrant bug 1 that managed to elude my attention. Here is an updated version with VDJ-122 and VDJ-221 modified (the definitions in my previous post are a prerequisite):&#xA;For u, v \in \mathcal{B}_{s,t} $u, v \in \mathcal{B}_{s,t}$, u \neq v $u \neq v$:&#xA;If dist_{G-\mathcal{B}_{s,t}+u+v}(u,v) $dist_{G-\mathcal{B}_{s,t}+u+v}(u,v) &lt; \infty$:&#xA;If dist(s,u) \le dist(s,v) $dist(s,u) \le dist(s,v)$:&#xA;Return True&#xA;Elif VDJ-122(\mathcal{B}_{s,t}, s, u, v) $(\mathcal{B}_{s,t}, s, u, v)$ and</description>

      <description>1 The detour problem The statement given by Antoine Amarilli is rephrased here:&#xA;Given a directed graph G = (V,E) $G = (V,E)$, a source s \in V $s \in V$ and a target t \in V $t \in V$ reachable from s $s$, decide if there a simple directed path from s $s$ to t $t$ whose length (in terms of edge count) is greater than that of the shortest path from s $s$ to t $t$.</description>

      <description>Suppose we have a Stern-Gerlach device exhibiting particle-like behavior 1, such that in the x $x$ direction, we have a complete basis: \{ |measure_{+x}\rangle, |measure_{-x}\rangle \} $\{ |measure_{+x}\rangle, |measure_{-x}\rangle \}$, akin to a spin-\frac{1}{2} $\frac{1}{2}$ particle, which has \{ |spin_{+x}\rangle, |spin_{-x}\rangle \} $\{ |spin_{+x}\rangle, |spin_{-x}\rangle \}$.&#xA;Suppose the Stern-Gerlach device is configured as in Feynman&#39;s beautiful exposition 2 to block the lower beam, allowing only particles that take the upper route to fly through.</description>

      <title>Jane Street Puzzle solution: Robot Long Jump</title>

      <description>Recently I found in my drawer some five pages of scribble dating back to Mar 2023, of my solution to that month&#39;s Jane Street Puzzle 1. Working on the puzzle was a wonderful process of meditation in a time of turmoil, and of reliving the peaceful memories of an aspiring student of math, statistics and computer science 2.&#xA;Somewhat surprisingly, I was able to recall the techniques in calculus and probability theory I hadn&#39;t touched for years.</description>

      <description>Although MathJax dominates today&#39;s html+latex landscape, I always feel reader-side rendering of latex leaves much to be desired.&#xA;After getting my writer-side svg generation and embedding engine up and running, I thought, why not write something to test drive it? So here it goes.&#xA;Mathematics First, note that a^b $a^b$ (a^b or a**b in most programming languages) is right associative. So, 2^{3^4} = 2^{81} $2^{3^4} = 2^{81}$, an enormous number of 25 digits, not (2^3)^4 $(2^3)^4$, which is merely 4096.</description>
